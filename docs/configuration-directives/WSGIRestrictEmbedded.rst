WSGIRestrictEmbedded
====================

:Description: Enable restrictions on use of embedded mode.
:Syntax: ``WSGIRestrictEmbedded On|Off``
:Default: ``WSGIRestrictEmbedded Off``
:Context: server config

The WSGIRestrictEmbedded directive determines whether mod_wsgi embedded
mode is enabled or not. If set to 'On' and the restriction on embedded mode
is therefore enabled, any attempt to make a request against a WSGI
application which hasn't been properly configured so as to be delegated to
a daemon mode process will fail with a HTTP internal server error response.

This option does not exist on Windows, or Apache 1.3 or any other
configuration where daemon mode is not available.

The default value "off" exists for backward compatibility. If unsure use "on".
