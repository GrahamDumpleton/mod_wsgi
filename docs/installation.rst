Installation
============

The mod_wsgi package can be installed from source code or may also be
available as a pre built binary package as part of your Linux distribution.

Do be aware though that Linux distributions generally ship out of date
versions of mod_wsgi and for long term support (LTS) versions of Linux can
be anything up to about 5 years old. Those older versions are not supported
in any way even though they are part of a so called LTS version of Linux.

If you want support and want to ensure you have the most up to date and
bug free version of mod_wsgi, you should consider building and installing
mod_wsgi from the source code.

For instructions on how to compile mod_wsgi from the source code for UNIX like
operating systems such as Linux and MacOS X see:

  * :doc:`user-guides/quick-installation-guide`
  * :doc:`user-guides/installation-on-macosx`

If you are on Windows, you should instead use:
