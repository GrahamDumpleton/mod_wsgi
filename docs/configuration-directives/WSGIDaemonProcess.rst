:Description: Configure a distinct daemon process for running applications.
:Syntax: ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` *name* ``[`` *options* ``]``
:Context: server config, virtual host

The ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` directive can be used to specify that distinct
daemon processes should be created to which the running of WSGI
applications can be delegated. Where Apache has been started as the
``root`` user, the daemon processes can be run as a user different to that
which the Apache child processes would normally be run as.

When distinct daemon processes are enabled and used, the process is
dedicated to mod_wsgi and the only thing that the processes do is run the
WSGI applications assigned to that process group. Any other Apache modules
such as PHP or activities such as serving up static files continue to be
run in the standard Apache child processes.

Note that having denoted that daemon processes should be created by
using the ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` directive, the ``WSGIProcessGroup``
directive, or the ``process-group`` option of ``WSGIScriptAlias`` still
needs to be used to delegate specific WSGI applications to execute within
those daemon processes.

Also note that the name of the daemon process group must be unique for the
whole server. That is, it is not possible to use the same daemon process
group name in different virtual hosts.

Options which can be supplied to the ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` directive are:

.. _processes:

**processes=num**
    Defines the number of daemon processes that should be started in this
    process group. If not defined then only one process will be run in this
    process group.

    Note that if this option is defined as ``processes=1``, then the WSGI
    environment attribute called ``wsgi.multiprocess`` will be set to be
    ``True`` whereas not providing the option at all will result in the
    attribute being set to be ``False``. This distinction is to allow for
    where some form of load balancing is used across process groups in the
    same Apache instance, or separate Apache instances. If you need to
    ensure that ``wsgi.multiprocess`` is ``False`` so that interactive
    debuggers will work, simply do not specify the ``processes`` option and
    allow the default single daemon process to be created in the process
    group.

.. _threads:

**threads=num**
    Defines the number of threads to be created to handle requests in each
    daemon process within the process group.

    If this option is not defined then the default will be to create 15
    threads in each daemon process within the process group.

    Do not get carried away and set this to a very large number in the
    belief that it will somehow magically enable you to handle many more
    concurrent users. Any sort of increased value would only be appropriate
    where your code is I/O bound. If you code is CPU bound, you are better
    of using at most 3 to 5 threads per process and using more processes.

    If you set the number of threads to 0 you will enable a special mode
    intended for using a daemon process to run a managed set of processes.
    You will need to use ``WSGIImportScript`` to pre-load a Python script
    into the main application group specified by ``%{GLOBAL}`` where the
    script runs a never ending task, or does an exec to run an external
    program. If the script or external program exits, the process is
    shutdown and replaced with a new one. For the case of using a Python
    script to run a never ending task, a ``SystemExit`` exception will be
    injected when a signal is received to shutdown the process. You can
    use ``signal.signal()`` to register a signal handler for ``SIGTERM``
    if needing to run special actions before then exiting the process using
    ``sys.exit()``, or to signal your own threads to exit any processing
    so you can shutdown in an orderly manner.

.. _display-name:

**display-name=value**
    Defines a different name to show for the daemon process when using the
    ``ps`` command to list processes. If the value is ``%{GROUP}`` then the
    name will be ``(wsgi:group)`` where ``group`` is replaced with the name
    of the daemon process group.

    Note that only as many characters of the supplied value can be displayed
    as were originally taken up by ``argv0`` of the executing process.
    Anything in excess of this will be truncated.

    This feature may not work as described on all platforms. Typically it
    also requires a ``ps`` program with BSD heritage. Thus on some versions
    of Solaris UNIX the ``/usr/bin/ps`` program doesn't work, but
    ``/usr/ucb/ps`` does. Other programs which can display this value
    include ``htop``.

.. _home:

**home=directory**
    Defines an absolute path of a directory which should be used as the
    initial current working directory of the daemon processes within the
    process group.

    If this option is not defined the initial current working directory
    will be set to be the home directory of the user that the daemon
    process is configured to run as using the ``user`` option to the
    ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` directive. Otherwise the current working
    directory of Apache when started will be used, which if Apache is being
    started from system init scripts, would usually be the system root
    directory.

.. _user:

**user=name | user=#uid**
    Defines the UNIX user *name* or numeric user *uid* of the user that
    the daemon processes should be run as. If this option is not supplied
    the daemon processes will be run as the same user that Apache would
    run child processes, as defined by the `User`_ directive, and it is
    not necessary to set this to the Apache user yourself.

    Note that this option is ignored if Apache wasn't started as the root
    user, in which case no matter what the settings, the daemon processes
    will be run as the user that Apache was started as.

    Also be aware that mod_wsgi will not allow you to run a daemon process
    group as the root user due to the security risk of running a web
    application as root.

.. _group:

**group=name | group=#gid**
    Defines the UNIX group *name* or numeric group *gid* of the primary
    group that the daemon processes should be run as. If this option is not
    supplied the daemon processes will be run as the same group that Apache
    would run child processes, as defined by the `Group`_ directive, and it
    is not necessary to set this to the Apache group yourself.

    Note that this option is ignored if Apache wasn't started as the root
    user, in which case no matter what the settings, the daemon processes
    will be run as the group that Apache was started as.

.. _supplementary-groups:

**supplementary-groups=group1 | supplementary-groups=group1,group2**
    Defines a list of additional UNIX groups that the user the daemon
    process group runs as, should be added to, in addition to primary
    UNIX group associated with that user. When specifying more than one
    group, separate the names of the groups with a comma.

.. _umask:

**umask=0nnn**
    Defines a value to be used for the umask of the daemon processes within
    the process group. The value must be provided as an octal number.

    If this option is not defined then the umask of the user that Apache is
    initially started as will be inherited by the process. Typically the
    inherited umask would be '0022'.

.. _lang:

**lang=locale**
    Set the current language locale. This is the same as having set the
    ``LANG`` environment variable.
    
    You will need to set this on many Linux systems where Apache when
    started up from system init scripts uses the default C locale, meaning
    that the default system encoding is ASCII. Unless you need a special
    language locale, set this to ``en_US.UTF-8``.

    Whether the ``lang`` or ``locale`` option works best can depend on the
    system being used. Set both if you aren't sure which is appropriate.

.. _locale:

**locale=locale**
    Set the current language locale. This is the same as having set the
    ``LC_ALL`` environment variable.
    
    You will need to set this on many Linux systems where Apache when
    started up from system init scripts uses the default C locale, meaning
    that the default system encoding is ASCII. Unless you need a special
    language locale, set this to ``en_US.UTF-8``.

    Whether the ``lang`` or ``locale`` option works best can depend on the
    system being used. Set both if you aren't sure which is appropriate.

.. _chroot:

**chroot=directory**
    Run the daemon process group process within a chroot jail. Use of a
    chroot jail is now deprecated due to the difficulty in setting up a
    chroot environment. It is recommended that you use more modern
    containerisation technologies such as Docker or runC.

.. _script-user:

**script-user=name | script-user=#uid**
    Sets the user that must be the owner of any WSGI script file delegated
    to be run in the daemon process group. If the owner doesn't match a
    HTTP Forbidden response will be returned for any request.

    Note that this doesn't change what user the daemon process group runs
    as at any time. If you want to set the user that the daemon process
    group runs as, use the ``user`` option. 

    Only one of ``script-user`` or ``script-group`` option can be used at
    the same time.

.. _script-group:

**script-group=name | script-group=#gid**
    Sets the group that must be the group of any WSGI script file delegated
    to be run in the daemon process group. If the group doesn't match a
    HTTP Forbidden response will be returned for any request.

    Note that this doesn't change what group the daemon process group runs
    as at any time. If you want to set the group that the daemon process
    group runs as, use the ``group`` option. 

    Only one of ``script-user`` or ``script-group`` option can be used at
    the same time.

.. _python-home:

**python-home=directory**
    Set the location of the Python virtual environment to be used by the
    daemon processes. The directory to use is that which ``sys.prefix`` is
    set to for the Python virtual environment. The virtual environment can
    have been created by ``virtualenv``, ``pyvenv`` or ``python -m venv``.

    Note that the Python virtual environment must have been created using
    the same base Python version as was used to compile the mod_wsgi
    module. You can't use this to force mod_wsgi to somehow use a different
    Python version than it was compiled for. If you want to use a different
    version of Python, you will need to reinstall mod_wsgi, compiling it
    for the version you want. It is not possible for the one mod_wsgi
    instance to run applications for both Python 2 and 3 at the same time.

.. _python-path:

**python-path=directory | python-path=directory:directory**
    List of colon separated directories to add to the Python module search
    path, ie., ``sys.path``.

    Note that this is not strictly the same as having set the ``PYTHONPATH``
    environment variable when running normal command line Python. When this
    option is used, the directories are added by calling
    ``site.addsitedir()``. As well as adding the directory to
    ``sys.path`` this function has the effect of opening and interpreting
    any ``.pth`` files located in the specified directories.

    If using a Python virtual environment, rather than use this option to
    refer to the ``site-packages`` directory of the Python virtual
    environment, you should use the ``python-home`` option to specify the
    root of the Python virtual environment instead.

    In all cases, if the directory contains Python packages which have C
    extension components, those packages must have been installed using the
    same base Python version as was used to compile the mod_wsgi module.
    You should not mix packages from different Python versions or
    installations.

.. _python-eggs:

**python-eggs=directory**
    Directory to be used as the Python egg cache directory. This is
    equivalent to having set the ``PYTHON_EGG_CACHE`` environment
    variable.

    Note that the directory specified must exist and be writable by the
    user that the daemon process run as.

.. _restart-interval:

**restart-interval=sss**
    Defines a time limit in seconds for how long a daemon process should
    run before being restarted.

    This might be use to periodically force restart the WSGI application
    processes when you have issues related to Python object reference count
    cycles, or incorrect use of in memory caching, which causes constant
    memory growth.

    If this option is not defined, or is defined to be 0, then the daemon
    process will be persistent and will continue to service requests until
    Apache itself is restarted or shutdown.

    Avoid setting this too low. This is because the constant restarting and
    reloading of your WSGI application may cause unecessary load on your
    system and affect performance.

    You can use the ``graceful-timeout`` option in conjunction with this
    option to reduce the chances that an active request will be interrupted
    when a restart occurs due to the use of this option.

.. _maximum-requests:

**maximum-requests=nnn**
    Defines a limit on the number of requests a daemon process should
    process before it is shutdown and restarted.

    This might be use to periodically force restart the WSGI application
    processes when you have issues related to Python object reference count
    cycles, or incorrect use of in memory caching, which causes constant
    memory growth.

    If this option is not defined, or is defined to be 0, then the daemon
    process will be persistent and will continue to service requests until
    Apache itself is restarted or shutdown.

    Avoid setting this to a low number of requests on a site which handles
    a lot of traffic. This is because the constant restarting and reloading
    of your WSGI application may cause unecessary load on your system and
    affect performance. Only use this option if you have no other choice
    due to a memory usage issue. Stop using it as soon as any memory issue
    has been resolved.

    You can use the ``graceful-timeout`` option in conjunction with this
    option to reduce the chances that an active request will be interrupted
    when a restart occurs due to the use of this option.

.. _inactivity-timeout:

**inactivity-timeout=sss**
    Defines the maximum number of seconds allowed to pass before the
    daemon process is shutdown and restarted when the daemon process has
    entered an idle state. For the purposes of this option, being idle
    means there are no currently active requests and no new requests are
    being received.

    This option exists to allow infrequently used applications running in
    a daemon process to be restarted, thus allowing memory being used to
    be reclaimed, with process size dropping back to the initial startup
    size before any application had been loaded or requests processed.

    Note that after any restart of the WSGI application process, the WSGI
    application will need to be reloaded. This can mean that the first
    request received by a process after the process was restarted can be
    slower. If you WSGI application has a very high startup cost on CPU and
    time, it may not be a good idea to use the option.

    See also the ``request-timeout`` option for forcing a process restart
    when requests block for a specified period of time.
    
    Note that similar functionality to that of the ``request-timeout``
    option, for forcing a restart when requests blocked, was part of what
    was implemented by the ``inactivity-timeout`` option. The request
    timeout was broken out into a separate feature in version 4.1.0 of
    mod_wsgi.

.. _request-timeout:

**request-timeout=sss**
    Defines the maximum number of seconds that a request is allowed to run
    before the daemon process is restarted. This can be used to recover
    from a scenario where a request blocks indefinitely, and where if all
    request threads were consumed in this way, would result in the whole
    WSGI application process being blocked.

    How this option is seen to behave is different depending on whether a
    daemon process uses only one thread, or more than one thread for
    handling requests, as set by the ``threads`` option.

    If there is only a single thread, and so the process can only handle
    one request at a time, as soon as the timeout has passed, a restart of
    the process will be initiated.

    If there is more than one thread, the request timeout is applied to
    the average running time for any requests, across all threads. This
    means that a request can run longer than the request timeout. This is
    done to reduce the possibility of interupting other running requests,
    and causing a user to see a failure. So where there is still capacity
    to handle more requests, restarting of the process will be delayed
    if possible.

.. _deadlock-timeout:

**deadlock-timeout=sss**
    Defines the maximum number of seconds allowed to pass before the
    daemon process is shutdown and restarted after a potential deadlock on
    the Python GIL has been detected. The default is 300 seconds.

    This option exists to combat the problem of a daemon process freezing
    as the result of a rogue Python C extension module which doesn't
    properly release the Python GIL when entering into a blocking or long
    running operation.

.. _startup-timeout:

**startup-timeout=sss**
    Defines the maximum number of seconds allowed to pass waiting to see if
    a WSGI script file can be loaded successfully by a daemon process. When
    the timeout is passed, the process will be restarted.

    This can be used to force the reloading of a process when a transient
    issue occurs on the first attempt to load the WSGI script file, but
    subsequent attempts still fail because a Python package that was loaded
    has retained state that prevents attempts to run initialisation a
    second time within the same process. The Django package can cause this
    scenario as the initialisation of Django itself can no longer be
    attempted more than once in the same process.

.. _graceful-timeout:

**graceful-timeout=sss**
    When ``maximum-requests`` is used and the maximum has been reached,
    or ``cpu-time-limit`` is used and the CPU limit reached, or
    ``restart-interval`` is used and the time limit reached, if
    ``graceful-timeout`` is set, then the process will continue to run for
    the number of second specified by this option, while still accepting
    new requests, to see if the process reaches an idle state. If the
    process reaches an idle state, it will then be resarted immediately. If
    the process doesn't reach an idle state and the graceful restart
    timeout expires, the process will be restarted, even if it means that
    requests may be interrupted.

.. _eviction-timeout:

**eviction-timeout=sss**
    When a daemon process is sent the graceful restart signal, usually
    ``SIGUSR1``, to restart a process, this timeout controls how many
    seconds the process will wait, while still accepting new requests,
    before it reaches an idle state with no active requests and shutdown.

    If this timeout is not specified, then the value of the
    ``graceful-timeout`` will instead be used. If the ``graceful-timeout``
    is not specified, then the restart when sent the graceful restart
    signal will instead happen immediately, with the process being forcibly
    killed, if necessary, when the shutdown timeout has expired.

.. _shutdown-timeout:

**shutdown-timeout=sss**
    Defines the maximum number of seconds allowed to pass when waiting for
    a daemon process to shutdown. When this timeout has been reached the
    daemon process will be forced to exited even if there are still active
    requests or it is still running Python exit functions. The shutdown
    timeout is applied after any graceful restart timeout or eviction
    timeout if they have been specified. No new requests are accepted
    during the shutdown timeout is being applied.

    If this option is not defined, then the shutdown timeout will be set
    to 5 seconds. Note that this option does not change the shutdown
    timeout applied to daemon processes when Apache itself is being stopped
    or restarted. That timeout value is defined internally to Apache as 3
    seconds and cannot be overridden.

.. _connect-timeout:

**connect-timeout=sss**
    Defines the maximum amount of time for an Apache child process to wait
    trying to get a successful connection to the mod_wsgi daemon processes.
    This defaults to 15 seconds.

.. _socket-timeout:

**socket-timeout=sss**
    Defines the timeout on individual reads/writes on the socket connection
    between the Apache child processes and the mod_wsgi daemon processes.
    If this is not specified, the number of seconds specified by the
    Apache `Timeout`_ directive will be used instead.

.. _queue-timeout:

**queue-timeout=sss**
    Defines the timeout on how long to wait for a mod_wsgi daemon process
    to accept a request for processing.

    This option is to allow one to control what to do when backlogging of
    requests occurs. If the daemon process is overloaded and getting
    behind, then it is more than likely that a user will have given up on
    the request anyway if they have to wait too long. This option allows
    you to specify that a request that was queued up waiting for too long
    is discarded, allowing any transient backlog to be quickly discarded
    and not simply cause the daemon process to become even more backlogged.
    When this occurs the user will recieve a 504 Gateway Time Out response.

.. _listen-backlog:

**listen-backlog=nnn**
    Defines the depth of the daemon process socket listener queue. By
    default the limit is 100, although this is actually a hint, as
    different operating systems can have different limits on the maximum
    value or otherwise treat it in special ways.a

    This option can be set, along with ``queue-timeout`` to try and better
    handle back logging when the WGSI application gets overloaded.

.. _socket-user:

**socket-user=name | socket-user=#uid**
    Set the owner of the UNIX listener socket for the daemon process group.
    
    This can be used when using the Apache `PrivilegesMode`_ directive with
    value of ``SECURE`` to change the owner of the socket from the default
    Apache user, to the user under which the Apache child process which is
    attempting to connect to the daemon process group, will run when
    handling requests. This is necessary otherwise the Apache child worker
    process will not be able to connect to the listener socket for the
    mod_wsgi daemon process to proxy the request to the WSGI application.

    This option can also be used when using third party Apache modules such
    as mod_ruid, mod_ruid2, mod_suid as well as the ITK MPM for Apache.

.. _cpu-time:

**cpu-time-limit=sss**
    Define the maximum amount of CPU time a daemon process is allowed to
    consume before a shutdown is triggered and the daemon process
    restarted. The point of this is to provide some means of controlling
    potentially run away processes due to bad code that gets stuck in heavy
    processing loops.

    Note that CPU time used is recorded from when the daemon process is
    first created. This means that a process will eventually reach the
    limit in normal use and would be restarted. You can use the
    ``graceful-timeout`` option to reduce the chances that an active
    request will be interrupted.

.. _cpu-priority:

**cpu-priority=num**
    Sets the scheduling priority set to the daemon processes. This can be
    a number of the range -20 to 20. The default priority is 0. A lower
    priority gives more favourable scheduling.

.. _memory-limit:

**memory-limit=num**
    Sets the maximum amount of memory a daemon process can use. This will
    have no affect on some platforms as ``RLIMIT_AS``/``RLIMIT_DATA`` with
    ``setrlimit()`` isn't always implemented. For example MacOS X and older
    Linux kernel versions do not implement this feature. You will need to
    test whether this feature works or not before depending on it.

.. _virtual-memory-limit:

**virtual-memory-limit=num**
    Sets the maximum amount of virtual memory a daemon process can use.
    This will have no affect on some platforms as ``RLIMIT_VMEM`` with
    ``setrlimit()`` isn't always implemented. You will need to test whether
    this feature works or not before depending on it.

.. _stack-size:

**stack-size=nnn**
    The amount of virtual memory in bytes to be allocated for the stack
    corresponding to each thread created by mod_wsgi in a daemon process.

    This option would be used when running Linux in a VPS system which has
    been configured with a quite low 'Memory Limit' in relation to the
    'Context RSS' and 'Max RSS Memory' limits. In particular, the default
    stack size for threads under Linux is 8MB is quite excessive and could
    for such a VPS result in the 'Memory Limit' being exceeded before the
    RSS limits were exceeded. In this situation, the stack size should be
    dropped down to be in the region of 512KB (524288 bytes).

.. _receive-buffer-size:

**receive-buffer-size=nnn**
    Defines the UNIX socket buffer size for data being received by the
    daemon process from the Apache child process.

    This option may need to be used to override small default values set by
    certain operating systems and would help avoid possibility of deadlock
    between Apache child process and daemon process when the WSGI
    application generates large responses but doesn't consume request
    content. In general such deadlock problems would not arise with well
    behaved WSGI applications, but some spam bots attempting to post data
    to web sites are known to trigger the problem.

    The maximum possible value that can be set for the buffer size is
    operating system dependent and will need to be calculated through trial
    and error.

.. _send-buffer-size:

**send-buffer-size=nnn**
    Defines the UNIX socket buffer size for data being sent in the
    direction daemon process back to Apache child process.

    This option may need to be used to override small default values set by
    certain operating systems and would help avoid possibility of deadlock
    between Apache child process and daemon process when the WSGI
    application generates large responses but doesn't consume request
    content. In general such deadlock problems would not arise with well
    behaved WSGI applications, but some spam bots attempting to post data
    to web sites are known to trigger the problem.

    The maximum possible value that can be set for the buffer size is
    operating system dependent and will need to be calculated through trial
    and error.

.. _header-buffer-size:

**header-buffer-size=nnn**
    Defines the maximum size that a response header/value can be that is
    returned from a WSGI application. The default size is 32768 bytes. This
    might need to be overridden where excessively large response headers
    are returned, such as in custom authentication challenge schemes which
    use the ``WWW-Authenticate`` header.

.. _response-buffer-size:

**response-buffer-size=nnn**
    Defines the maximum number of bytes that will be buffered for a
    response in the Apache child processes when proxying the response body
    from the WSGI application. The default size is 65536 bytes. Be careful
    increasing this to provide extra buffering of responses as it
    contributes to the runtime memory size of the Apache child processes.

.. _response-socket-timeout:

**response-socket-timeout=nnn**
    Defines the maximum number of seconds allowed to pass before timing out
    on a write operation back to the HTTP client when the response buffer
    has filled and data is being forcibly flushed. Defaults to 0 seconds
    indicating that it will default to the value of the ``socket-timeout``
    option.

To delegate a particular WSGI application to run in a named set of daemon
processes, the ``WSGIProcessGroup`` directive should be specified in
appropriate context for that application, or the ``process-group`` option
used on the ``WSGIScriptAlias`` directive. If neither is used to delegate
the WSGI application to run in a daemon process group, the application will
be run within the standard Apache child processes.

If the ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` directive is specified outside of all virtual
host containers, any WSGI application can be delegated to be run within
that daemon process group. If the ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` directive is
specified within a virtual host container, only WSGI applications
associated with virtual hosts with the same server name as that virtual
host can be delegated to that set of daemon processes.

In the case where you have two separate ``VirtualHost`` definitions for
the same ``ServerName``, but where one is for port 80 and the other for
port 443, specify the ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` directive in the
first ``VirtualHost``. You can then refer to that daemon process group
by name from the second ``VirtualHost``. Using one daemon process group
across the two virtual hosts in this case is preferred as then you do not
have two whole separate instances of your application for port 80 and 443.

When ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` is associated with a virtual host, the error log
associated with that virtual host will be used for all Apache error log
output from mod_wsgi rather than it appear in the main Apache error log.

For example, if a server is hosting two virtual hosts and it is desired
that the WSGI applications related to each virtual host run in distinct
processes of their own and as a user which is the owner of that virtual
host, the following could be used::

  <VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName www.site1.com
  CustomLog logs/www.site1.com-access_log common
  ErrorLog logs/ww.site1.com-error_log

  WSGIDaemonProcess www.site1.com user=joe group=joe processes=2 threads=25
  WSGIProcessGroup www.site1.com

  ...
  </VirtualHost>

  <VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName www.site2.com
  CustomLog logs/www.site2.com-access_log common
  ErrorLog logs/www.site2.com-error_log

  WSGIDaemonProcess www.site2.com user=bob group=bob processes=2 threads=25
  WSGIProcessGroup www.site2.com

  ...
  </VirtualHost>

For historical reasons and the inability to change existing behaviour when
adding or changing features, many of the options to ``WSGIDaemonProcess``,
especially those related to timeouts are not enabled by default. It is
strongly recommended you explicitly set these options yourself as this will
give you a system which is better able to recover from backlogging due to
overloading when you have too many long running requests or hanging
requests. As a starting point you can see what ``mod_wsgi-express`` uses as
defaults, adjusting them as necessary to suit your specific application
after you research what each option does. For example, consider starting
out with:

* ``display-name='%{GROUP}'``

* ``lang='en_US.UTF-8'``
* ``locale='en_US.UTF-8'``

* ``threads=5``

* ``queue-timeout=45``
* ``socket-timeout=60``
* ``connect-timeout=15``
* ``request-timeout=60``
* ``inactivity-timeout=0``
* ``startup-timeout=15``
* ``deadlock-timeout=60``
* ``graceful-timeout=15``
* ``eviction-timeout=0``
* ``restart-interval=0``
* ``shutdown-timeout=5``
* ``maximum-requests=0``

Note that the ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` directive and corresponding features are
not available on Windows.
