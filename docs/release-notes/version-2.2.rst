Bug Fixes
---------

1. Fix bug whereby if mod_python is loaded at same time as mod_wsgi the
WSGIImportScript directive can cause Apache child processes to crash.
For details see:

  https://code.google.com/archive/p/modwsgi/issues/91

2. Fix bug where mod_wsgi daemon process startup could fail due to old stale
UNIX listener socket file as described in:

  https://code.google.com/archive/p/modwsgi/issues/77

3. Fix bug where listener socket file descriptors for daemon processes were
being leaked in Apache parent process on a graceful restart. Also fixes
problem where UNIX listener socket was left in filesystem on both graceful
restart and graceful shutdown. For details see:

  https://code.google.com/archive/p/modwsgi/issues/95

4. Fix bug where response was truncated when a null character appeared as
first character in block of data being returned from wsgi.file_wrapper. Only
occurred when code fell back to using iteration over supplied file like
object, rather than optimised method such as sendfile().
