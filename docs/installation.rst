Installation
============

The mod_wsgi package can be installed from source code or may also be
available as a pre built binary package as part of your Linux distribution.

Do be aware though that Linux distributions can sometimes ship out of date
versions of mod_wsgi, especially for long term support (LTS) versions of Linux.
Those older versions are not supported in any way even though they are part of a
so called LTS version of Linux.

If you want support and want to ensure you have the most up to date and
bug free version of mod_wsgi, you should consider building and installing
mod_wsgi from the source code.

For instructions on how to compile mod_wsgi from the source code for UNIX like
operating systems such as Linux and MacOS X see:

  * :doc:`user-guides/quick-installation-guide`
  * :doc:`user-guides/installation-on-macosx`

For a simpler way of running a Python WSGI application using mod_wsgi, also
checkout ``mod_wsgi-express``, details of which can currently be found at:
